          <h3>Getting functional with Erlang</h3>
          <p>
            This book aims to get you started with <strong>writing Erlang applications right from the get go</strong>. After some initial chapters introducing the language syntax and basic language features we will dive straight into building Erlang applications. While <strong>writing actual code</strong> you will <strong>discover</strong> and <strong>learn</strong> more about the different Erlang and OTP features. Each application we create is geared towards a different use-case, exposing the different mechanics of Erlang.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want this to become the book I would have read myself, simple and to the point. Something to help you get functional with Erlang quickly. <strong>I imagine you; with one hand holding your e-reader while typing code with the other hand</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have made a broad assumption: Because only smart people would want to learn Erlang (that is you), that you are then also smart enough to find your way to all the language specifics when needed. So this book is <strong>no</strong>t meant as a <strong>complete reference</strong> guide for Erlang. But it will teach you enough to give you a <strong>running start</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have reached the end of this book you will be able to build a <strong>full blown Erlang application</strong> and release it into production. You will <strong>understand the core Erlang features</strong> like; pattern matching, message passing, working with processes, and hot code swapping.

              <h3>Why Leanpub?</h3>
              <p>
                As a Leanpub reader, you will receive updates to books when new versions are released or chapters are added, until the book is finished. By buying an in-progress book, you'll gain immediate access to the author's latest thinking on a subject, which can be very useful for technical subjects. Why wait until the knowledge in a book is common knowledge, when you can read it as soon as the author finished writing it? You also have the opportunity to interact with the author, commenting on his or her book page, or even communicating directly via email or Twitter. Good authors love feedback from good readers!
