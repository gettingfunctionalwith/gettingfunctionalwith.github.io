            This book aims to get you started with writing Erlang applications right from the get go. After some initial chapters introducing the language syntax and basic language features we will dive straight into building Erlang applications. While writing actual code you will discover and learn more about the different Erlang and OTP features. Each application we create is geared towards a different use-case, exposing the different mechanics of Erlang.

            I want this to become the book I would have read myself, simple and to the point. Something to help you get functional with Erlang quickly. I imagine you; with one hand holding your e-reader and typing code with the other hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have made a broad assumption: Because only smart people would want to learn Erlang (that is you), that you are then also smart enough to find your way to all the language specifics when needed. So this book is not meant as a complete reference guide for Erlang. But it will teach you enough to give you a running start.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you have reached the end of this book you will be able to build a full blown Erlang application and release it into production. You will understand the core Erlang features like; pattern matching, message passing, working with processes, and hot code swapping.
